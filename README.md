# parallel-plotting

The aim of this proyect is to generate and/or save a plot of parallel coordinates. You can choose between three different libraries: bokeh, plotly and pyplot. In addition, I have add some extra functionalities that can be used passing to the function different parameters, such as normalize the data

##Structure

- ``Code``: you can find the *Script* parallelCoordinates.
- ``Documentation``: you can find the *.md* and *ipynb* *Scripts* that have the documentations of parallelCoordinates *File*.
- ``Results``: you can find some of the results that I have had using parallelCoordinates *File*.
- ``Tests``: you can find the unittest of the code.
- ``Data``: Place where the data used for the Jupyter notebooks and tests is stored.
